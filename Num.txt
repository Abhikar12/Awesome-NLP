Your smile makes me smile Your laugh makes me laugh Your eyes are enchanting You make my thoughts seem daft Since the day I first laid eyes on you My feelings grew and grew In that first conversation my knees clicked and clacked And those butterflies flipped and flapped And as I spill these simple rhymes My mind goes over time and time I have a crush, a little teenage crush I dont know what to do, about this lovely little crush
